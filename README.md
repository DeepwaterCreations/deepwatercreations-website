# deepwatercreations-website
My personal website, live at www.deepwatercreations.com. 
Contains a blog. Used to contain a portfolio of creative projects, but now most of that's either here on GitHub or being submitted to fiction magazines. Uses Angular.js for the frontend and some PHP scripts + a MySQL database for the backend. Also, the logo and blog page navigation buttons are all my own artwork.
